# Every polling loop in this module (post-rebase status checks,

# After a sibling PR merges (or a concurrent dependamerge run lands a
# change), GitHub recomputes a PR's mergeability asynchronously and
# briefly reports ``mergeable=null`` / ``mergeable_state="unknown"`` —
# typically for a few seconds.  Before dispatching a merge in a
# repo-scoped batch we re-read the PR and, when GitHub is still
# computing, poll up to this many seconds for a concrete value so the
# merge decision is made against fresh state rather than the
# (possibly stale) fetch-time snapshot.

# First-poll delay for the auto-merge wait loop.  The loop's steady
# cadence is ``DEFAULT_MERGE_RECHECK_INTERVAL`` (10s), but the *first*
# refresh happens after this much shorter delay: when auto-merge fires
# the moment it is armed (checks were already green and approval was
# the only blocker) a full-interval first sleep would discover the
# merge ~8 seconds late — per PR, serialized per repository in striped
# runs.  One extra lightweight GET is a fair trade for that.

        Owner-wide batches frequently contain several PRs targeting the
        same repository (e.g. dependabot and pre-commit-ci both opening
        PRs in one repo).  Merging two PRs in the same repository
        back-to-back races GitHub's branch-protection / mergeability
        propagation.  To avoid that structurally (no injected delays, no
        random retries) this scheduler:

        - Groups PRs by repository, preserving first-seen order.
        - Runs one worker coroutine per repository that processes that
          repository's PRs strictly sequentially, so **at most one PR per
          repository is ever in flight**.
        - Lets distinct repositories run concurrently, bounded by the
          shared merge semaphore.  When a repository releases its slot
          between PRs it re-acquires the semaphore for its next PR,
          competing afresh with other repositories' waiting PRs.  In
          practice CPython wakes semaphore waiters in roughly the order
          they blocked, so this tends to round-robin ("stripe") work
          across repositories — but that ordering is only a best-effort
          optimisation, not a correctness property.  Fairness is **not**
          part of the public ``asyncio.Semaphore`` contract and is not
          relied upon: the single-flight-per-repository invariant above
          comes solely from each repository's serial worker, regardless
          of the order in which the semaphore admits waiters.

        Combined with ``repo_scoped`` mergeability refresh, when a
        repository's second PR finally starts it re-reads state the first
        PR's merge may have invalidated.

          add the PR to ``_auto_merge_enabled``, post the audit
          comment, and return ``True``.
        - GraphQL mutation reports failure (commonly because

          omits ``autoMergeRequest`` or the request raises): fall
          back to a REST GET on the PR and inspect ``auto_merge``.
          If non-null, treat as already-enabled — add the PR to
          ``_auto_merge_enabled`` (so the Step 6 skip gate still
          routes it to ``AUTO_MERGE_PENDING`` rather than
          attempting a 405-prone manual merge) and return ``True``,
          but skip the audit comment so re-runs against an
          already-configured PR don't post duplicates.
        - GraphQL mutation reports failure AND the PR has no
          ``auto_merge`` set: auto-merge is genuinely unavailable
          (e.g. the repository setting is off, the PR has
          conflicts, no required-checks are configured). Return
          ``False`` and let the caller fall through to manual
          polling/merge.

        """Detect whether a *required* verification check is stuck.

        Required checks (DCO, lint, build, license scans, etc.)
        normally start reporting within a handful of seconds.  When
        one has been queued / in-progress / pending for longer than
        :data:`STUCK_CHECK_THRESHOLD_SECONDS` on a PR that itself was
        created and last updated more than that long ago, treat it
        as stuck so the caller can decide whether to ask dependabot
        to recreate the PR (the only reliable recovery for a
        dependabot PR with no ``recreate``/``rebase`` macro of its
        own once a required check has stalled indefinitely).

        Only checks that are *required* on the PR's base branch are
        considered, since a non-required check cannot block the
        merge.  DCO-shaped checks are additionally always treated as
        eligible as a safety net: the GitHub DCO App check is the
        canonical stuck-check case and is effectively always blocking
        where it is enabled, even when the required-checks lookup
        cannot enumerate it.

        ``pre-commit.ci`` checks are explicitly excluded here even
        when required — they have their own dedicated recovery via
        :meth:`_trigger_stale_precommit_ci`, which posts the
        ``pre-commit.ci run`` comment (dependabot's ``recreate`` macro
        does not retrigger pre-commit.ci).

        The age floor on PR ``created_at`` / ``updated_at`` avoids
        false positives on PRs that were touched seconds before we
        observed them — in those cases the check is simply running
        normally and should be allowed to finish.

        in the same repo-scoped batch has turned ``dirty`` (the classic
        shared-``uv.lock`` conflict) since the one-shot fetch snapshot.
        Routing such a PR straight to conflict recovery avoids
        dispatching a doomed merge that 405s and then churns
        :meth:`_merge_pr_with_retry`'s retry loop against the stale
        ``clean`` snapshot (which misreads the 405 as a transient error
        on a mergeable PR and sleeps under the dispatch lock before
        re-fetching).

        Deliberately a *single* GET with no recompute poll — unlike
        :meth:`_refresh_pr_mergeability`, which polls GitHub's
        "still computing" window and therefore runs only *after* a
        failed merge, off the lock.  The dispatch lock is the one point
        serialised *and* ordered after a sibling merge, so polling here
        would serialise the whole repo batch.  We therefore act only on
        a *concrete* ``dirty``; a still-computing, closed, non-dirty, or
        errored result returns ``False`` so the merge attempt proceeds
        and the off-lock post-failure refresh settles anything that
        turns out to be a fresh conflict.

        Mutates ``pr_info`` (``mergeable``, ``mergeable_state``,
        ``head_sha``) only when it confirms a concrete ``dirty``, so the
        conflict handler and failure summary report accurate state.  The
        snapshot is otherwise left untouched — in particular a transient
        ``unknown`` never overwrites a concrete ``clean``, preserving the

        The batch of PRs is fetched once up front, so a worker may act
        on a snapshot taken seconds-to-minutes earlier.  In a
        repo-scoped run this is routinely wrong: merging one PR can
        immediately make a sibling PR ``dirty`` (the classic
        ``uv.lock`` / workflow-pin conflict) or ``behind``.  A
        concurrent ``dependamerge`` run elsewhere in the org can do the
        same.

        This method is the **post-failure** half of the conflict-
        detection pair, called from ``_merge_single_pr`` *after* a
        repo-scoped merge attempt returns falsy and always **outside**
        the per-repo dispatch lock.  It catches the case where a PR
        turned ``dirty`` *during* our own merge window (a sibling
        merged between the pre-dispatch check and the merge call) so a
        freshly-conflicted PR is routed to conflict recovery rather
        than reported as a generic merge failure.  The complementary
        **pre-dispatch** check is the single-GET ``_is_pr_dirty_now``,
        which runs *inside* the dispatch lock; the polling done here
        deliberately stays off that lock so GitHub's recompute window
        never serialises the whole repo batch.

        GitHub recomputes ``mergeable`` / ``mergeable_state``
        asynchronously after the base branch moves, reporting
        ``mergeable=None`` and ``mergeable_state="unknown"`` (or an
        empty string) in the gap — usually for a few seconds.  When we
        catch the PR in that window we poll up to
        :data:`MERGEABILITY_REFRESH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` for a concrete
        value so the merge decision is made against real data.

        Mutates ``pr_info`` in place (``state``, ``mergeable``,
        ``mergeable_state``, ``head_sha``).  Best-effort: any API error
        leaves the existing snapshot untouched so the caller's

        Detecting the requirement up-front lets us approve proactively and

        enumeration was not possible, do we fall back to GitHub's
